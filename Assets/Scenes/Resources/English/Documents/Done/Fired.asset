  body: 'Dear Timothy,

    i am very sorry to inform you, that you will have to
    be let go from the ship and your duties in it. According to multiple sources,
    you''ve been trafficking alien beasts using this ship''s containment cells, that
    are meant to keep the pets of everyone on board safe.


    You, alongside the
    foul creatures you have in your containment, will be deported from the ship at
    once, please don''t try to resist, you know any type of firing would result in
    your death, it''s in your contract


    Sincerely, Nictos''s very own Alan Nicotos'
