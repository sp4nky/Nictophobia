    YOU GUYS NEED
    TO STOP LEAVING BOXES EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!. They are everywhere from the halls,
    the bathrooms, the bedrooms and even in the common rooms. Today i had to eat
    on foot, because there was a box on top of the table.

    

    WE HAVE A ROOM
    DEDICATED FOR STORAGE

    

    This is the last time i ask...

    

    Sincerely,
    Elizabeth Draper.'
