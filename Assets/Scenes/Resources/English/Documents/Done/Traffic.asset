  title: 'From: Jim from HR

    To: Tim from Resource Managment'
  body: 'Tim, the creature you are holding captive in the basement of the ship has
    to go, i can''t put my head out for you anymore. The rest of HR knows that we
    are up to something.


    Most i can give you is a week, to get a seller, this
    creature surely sells for good money., especiialy since a lot of people use it
    as some sort of dancer....


    Anyway, we got to get rid of it quick.


    Signed,
    Jim'
